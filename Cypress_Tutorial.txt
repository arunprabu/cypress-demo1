create new react project 
  npx create-react-app myapp 

  cd myapp 
  code .

  npm i cypress -save-dev

in package.json,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "cypress": "cypress open",   /// Add this one
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },

Then, in cmd prompt, 
  npm run cypress 

It will open a new window. And look at the instruction there.

To use Plugins in Cypress

Ref: https://testing-library.com/docs/    -- Look at Frameworks

Let's use https://testing-library.com/docs/cypress-testing-library/intro 

First,
  npm install --save-dev cypress @testing-library/cypress

Then, Add this line to your project's cypress/support/commands.js:
  import '@testing-library/cypress/add-commands';


You can now use all of DOM Testing Library's findBy, findAllBy, queryBy and queryAllBy commands off the global cy object. 
See the DOM Testing Library docs for reference.
